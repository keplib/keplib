### Hi there, I'm BalÃ¡zs ðŸ‘‹! 

I'm a fullstack engineer originally from Hungary but currently based in Barcelona, Spain. 
I have a strong background in science (degrees in physics and audio engineering) and 5+ years business experience working in tech companies (mainly in product). 
I started coding with Python during my studies and got familiar with creative coding and IoT while working with sound (p5.js, Processing, Arduino, Supercollider). In the last two years I've been focusing on leveling up my web development skills. 

I'm always passionate about learning new technologies and frameworks. 

Outside of programming I enjoy music, creative coding and biking and cooking. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Huddler in a team of six fellow developers. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Svelte, Deno and serverless architectures.
